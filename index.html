                  Maths builds up your child's ability to come up with a plan and strategies to solve problems. 
                It's an important skill that
                 they can practise throughout their life and from a very early age. 
                 Mathematics provides an effective way of building mental discipline and encourages logical reasoning
                  and mental rigor. In addition, mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in understanding the
                   contents of other school subjects 
                 such as science, social studies, and even music and art.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text.small">Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes kno
                    wledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
                    The earliest roots in the history of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and
                     Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, 
                     and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity,
                      whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world 
                      based on natural causes.[3][4] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions 
                      of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages,
                    but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.
